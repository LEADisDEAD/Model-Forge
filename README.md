# Model Forge
**Where raw data meets the heat of machine learning**

A fully-automated machine learning platform to train, compare, and select the best-performing classification models ‚Äî all from a simple CSV file.

Model Forge isn‚Äôt just a tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a battleground where raw data is forged into powerful predictive models using the heat of algorithms.

Built with Streamlit + Scikit-learn, it handles preprocessing, outlier removal, model training, evaluation, and visual reporting ‚Äî no coding required.

üöß _This project is still in development._

## Features

- Upload Any CSV and pick your target column.
- Automatic data cleaning, missing value imputation, and encoding.
- Choose between:

    - Pro Mode: Compare all models simultaneously.
    - Manual Mode: Select and tune a specific model.


- Supports multiple classification algorithms:

    - Random Forest

    - Logistic Regression

    - Support Vector Machine

    - K-Nearest Neighbors

    - MLP (Neural Network)
 
    - ‚öíÔ∏è More to be added soon!

- Evaluation on:
    - Accuracy
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - F1-Score.

- Auto-detection of binary vs multi-class problems (for metric calculations).

- Optional outlier handling (Z-Score / IQR methods).

- Built-in classification reports with download support.

- Save and download the best-performing trained model.

## How it works

- Upload a .csv file and choose the column to predict.

- Model Forge preprocesses the data: imputes missing values, encodes categories, scales numerics.

- Detects and optionally removes outliers.

- Trains models using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

- Compares their performance on multiple metrics.

- Highlights and saves the best model.

- Presents a downloadable report and model file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setupp & Run

- 1.Clone the Repository
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/LEADisDEAD/ModelForge.git
  cd ModelForge

  ```
- 2.Create virtual environment

  ```
  python -m venv .venv
  .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
  # OR
  source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
  ```
- 3.Install dependencies

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- 4.Run the app

  ```
  streamlit run app.py
  ```

---

## Example use cases:

- Academic research for classification problems

- Rapid prototyping for AI solutions

- Automated baselines before deep learning
  
- Teaching ML model evaluation in classrooms

---

## NOTES:

- This project only supports classification tasks (binary or multi-class).

- Permutation importance was intentionally removed to reduce complexity and dependency bugs.

- Feature importances for models like Random Forest will be added in future updates.

- You can extend ml_backend.py to include more algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, CatBoost).



- Model selection for production pipelines
